# The Course

The entire Cold Hawaii Ultra race courses go from Bulbjerg and Vester Thorup in the north to Agger
in the south and makes use of the West Coast trail and the old lifeboat road. The running surface is
a mix of sand, beach, small paths, single trails, wheel tracks, gravel roads, and a few paved roads
through some of the small villages. Runners on the two longest courses start in Bulbjerg and the
remaining courses join further south on the way to Agger.

The interactive map found below shows the race area. The red pins indicate the location of the start
areas and the orange pins indicate the location of the aid stations. The first 20 km leg of the 100
km course has not been published yet.

All courses are clearly marked using small orange flags. For participants doing 50 miles, 50 km, 24
km, and 12 km it is sufficient to follow the flags. However, the first 20 km of the 100 km course is
**not** marked using flags and participants must use a GPS unit for navigation. It is the
participant's own responsibility to bring a GPS unit and load the provided GPX file.

GPX files can be downloaded using the links below.
